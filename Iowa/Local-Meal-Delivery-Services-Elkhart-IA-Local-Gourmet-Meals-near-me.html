<p>There are a plethora of different food options in the Miami, and you will find that many of them are quite exotic. The problem, is that it is not entirely friendly to those who find themselves on a diet. This makes healthy food delivery Miami  all the more important.</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/8NJZGeTy9sY" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><h4>Healthy Food Delivery Atlanta</h4><p>These meals were both healthy and delicious!  My girlfriend and I received these meals as a gift from her niece as it was a very trying time and there wasn't any time to cook!  We would receive a couple days worth of meals delivered at our door step in lovely refrigerated bags and the variety offered was very tasty and extremely healthy which was important to my best friend!  Even the deserts were fun and tasty and we looked forward to each meal!  Lola was very accommodating when it came to switching out some items due to food allergies which I felt was great customer service!  Thank you Healthy Express for making our lives less complicated and keeping us well nourished during that trying time!  Jeanine</p>
<img alt="healthy food delivery for two" src="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/healthymealdeliverymiami-140526012230-phpapp02/95/miami-diet-delivery-1-638.jpg?cb=1401067396" width="856" height="480"><p>I found a deal through Gilt and gave it a try and ordered the balanced meal plan for a week. Food always looked like it had been thrown into the containers, did not look very apeticing, and tasted just ok... there are so many other options out there offering meal flexibility and much better options. Don't waste your money here...</p>
<p>Really, really good.  Very fresh, creative ingredients.If this were a restaurant, I would go back for all of these dishes.  I look forward to seeing what the next dishes will be - always knowing that they are going to be very satisfying and healthy.  I don't have to struggle to figure out how to eat a healthy, balanced diet on my own. Highly recommend.</p>
<h4>Healthy Food Delivery Las Vegas</h4><p>I bought a Groupon for Healthy Xpress at a really good price and figured I'd give it a try. As a mom, who struggles with her weight, I always prepare meals for my family and then take care of myself last. I wanted something that was easy to help me in my New Year goals. I couldn't believe how easy and delicious Healthy Xpress was. Makes my life so much easier! I can still take care of my family and their needs and finally I'm taking care of myself as well. After using the groupon I ended up ordering another week of food and just recently did a 4 week order - the portions are HUGE - the food is fresh, well seasoned and keeps me full. I'm so glad I found them!!!</p>
<h4>Healthy Food Delivery Austin</h4><p>Sustainable eating is all about eating food that has been grown or raised in a way that is manageable over the long-term. A food source is sustainable only if it produces food responsibly. At FIB we care about where your food comes from so we focus on finding partners that support this philosophy.</p>
<p>I just recently began the Paleo deliveries from Healthy Xpress and I am so incredibly pleased! They catered to my tomato allergy and didn't send any food with tomato and labeled the containers "no tomato." The delivery is always on point and communication is great with the company people. The food is delicious and keeps me full all day long. Along with working out and eating what is delivered I lost 3lbs in my first week and I am looking forward to continuing my delivery and seeing results!</p>
<p>Great healthy food! I've never had a problem with them, food tastes great, help me meet my fitness goals. I started off with Paleo to trim a few pounds and then later changed to the balanced meal plan that I absolutely loved. I've tried several other companies before Healthy Xpress and I have to say that this is the only one where I actually looked forward to eating my meals. The GButter is a must try!!</p>
<p>The Food - I've tried 4 food delivery services in the last few years and this one was by far the better decision. I had chosen the balanced plan which included the proper amount of proteins, fats, carbs, and fibers that I needed to meet my macros. They also have all the nutritional facts on their website for the entire week for each individual meal. I will have to say, the food was absolutely amazing. They kept a good variety of healthy and delicious options. Every meal was full of flavors and didn't end up tasting "bland" like a lot of the food delivery services I tried in the past. You're in for in treat especially the day you get their churrasco. Service - A+. My food was always delivered in the mornings and on time. If I was still at home when the delivery was made, put it in the fridge. If I had to leave a bit earlier and miss the delivery, they pack the bag with ice packs ready for me once I got home in the evening. When I needed to leave on vacation for a few weeks, they were able to freeze my services while I was gone and resume it right when I got back. HealthyXpress is the real deal. Their food and their service are exactly what you look for in a food delivery service and a business overall.</p>

Ive tried two other meal delivery services and the biggest difference (positive) is the variety of food from day to day/week to week. I also like how they deliver three times a week as opposed to two, which means the food is fresh. Ive meal prepped as well which can get old eating the same things throughout the week. I enjoy the cpnvience of having the meals delivered throughout the week and look forward to trying the different meals they offer. Good company. Great meal options. Definitely reccomend. Thanks for taking care of the ambush athletes!</p>
<h3>Healthy Xpress Madison 50073</h3><p>I'm on the Paleo meal plan and absolutely love it. The meals are delicious and I feel satisfied and never hungry. I have many food allergies and the team has been great about handling my meals properly I love working with their team and the service has made my life much easier- they take the  guesswork out healthy eating and I'm incredibly happy with the results. Not only do I feel better, but I look better- I've gotten many compliments on my skin since I've started eating Healthy Xpress.</p>
