Just be prepared for a freezer full of ice packs. —Christine Yu, with Lisa Elaine Held and Molly Gallagher</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/iiv90MFqrTs" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Need-to-know: One look at Provenance Meals’ website and you know that the company prioritizes seasonal eats and ingredients your grandmother would recognize. Order from their weekly menu of prepared meals, with nourishing options for vegetarians, vegans and Paleos alike (debuts every Tuesday)—like the Vitality Bowl of the Week (which, on a recent week, included millets, chickpeas, greens, and roasted roots with Romesco sauce). Or, if you need to detox, sign up for their super popular Whole Food Detox box. You’ll receive three clean, plant-based meals a day for one, three, five, or 20 days—your choice!</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/IewKe8wGAgA" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><h3>How To Start A Healthy Food Delivery Service Florida 32158</h3><p>Delivery details: Fresh Direct has delivery experience, and it showed, proving it to be uber reliable, key for someone with a busy schedule. Two-hour time slots run every day of the week from about 6:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., and they call or text you to let you know if your delivery is running late. They deliver throughout New York City, as well as in Long Island, Westchester, and parts of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware, plus in the Hamptons and Jersey Shore during the summer.</p>
<img alt="healthy food delivery for families" src="http://www.babyboomster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Diet-Meal-Plans.jpg" width="856" height="480"><p>Need-to-know: Diced’s founder Tinsley Meloy wanted to make the gluten-free world a little bit more convenient and easier to navigate, so she created this 100 percent gluten-free meal kit. Everyone from vegans and vegetarians to carnivores will find something to drool over on the core seasonal menu or the weekly specials (which do sell out!).</p>
<h3>Healthy Food Delivery To Office</h3><p>“Even though we worked hard to keep this at a minimum, we still saw a fair amount of food waste at the end of each shift, which in turn has both a steep cost on an environmental level as well as a unit economics level. I’m sure others in the space are seeing this as well,” Cheriyan said. “We thought there was a better way and this was a key driver of why we moved to a scheduled delivery subscription model.”</p>
<img alt="healthy food take out near me" src="http://image4.slideserve.com/7334892/best-vietnamese-food-in-san-francisco-n.jpg" width="856" height="480"><p>Another meal kit, this one from former Slanted Door chef Justine Kelly. A few great things about this one: You can customize your meals, first within a category (Paleo, gluten-free, vegetarian, etc.) and then the actual meals. You don’t just get what you get, as is the case with many other meal kits. I opted for baked eggs with tomatoes and pistou, turkey sausage with beet apple salad and walnut vinaigrette, and shrimp with blood orange-jicama salad with salsa verde. “Clean” or not, this is the kind of food I want to be eating. Also great: Each meal’s ingredients come in a paper bag, so there aren’t a million ingredients and individual bags, meaning there’s less waste. And there’s a paid shipping label so you can send back all of the ridiculous packaging that keeps everything fresh and cold. Overall, at $11.50/serving, it’s a winner — possibly my favorite so far of the meal kits I’ve tried. www.sunbasket.com</p>
<h4>Healthy Food Gift Baskets For Delivery Florida Putnam County 32158</h4><p>Healthy factor: Picnic’s meals are made from minimally processed, seasonal ingredients sourced from trusted local farms. All dishes are grain-, dairy-, and gluten-free, not to mention contain no refined sugars or preservatives. Choose from a rotating menu of dishes with clever names like “Let’s Beet Reel” (teriyaki salmon and baby bok choy over beet-infused cauliflower rice) or “Impasta” (spaghetti squash and meatballs with bruschetta sauce). Currently, there are a limited number of meals available, but Picnic expects to expand its menu in the coming months.</p>
<img alt="healthy food delivery options" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/zesty_app_angled_small_cropped.jpg" width="856" height="480"><p>Munchery is the clear winner in terms of quality and diversity of options — and the fact that it allows you to order on-demand or plan ahead, cook, or simply heat up poises it for further national success, though there are the sourcing concerns. If even the minimal heating effort is too much for your day, Sprig with its beautiful imagery, simple user interface, quick delivery, and organic ingredients is also a good option, while SpoonRocket and Bento lag behind with confusing user experiences.</p>
<h3>How To Start Healthy Food Delivery Business</h3><p>What it’s all about: Sign up for a weekly subscription and you’ll get three deliveries per week of pre-portioned ingredients for meals that can be prepared in under 35 minutes, along with recipe cards. Price: A weekly subscription ranges from $59.94 for three meals for two people to $179.82 for three meals for six people. Sample item:Roasted Chicken with Jalapeño-Herb Salsa, Mixed Citrus, and Cracked Wheat Berries: Ingredients include chives, parsley, jalapeño pepper, shallots, white wine vinegar, pistachios, chicken breasts, cracked wheat berries, clementines, grapefruit, and tangelos.</p>
<p>Major takeaway: Munchery requires a bit more effort, but delivers the best flavors and nicest presentation. The company is already poised for national expansion with delivery areas in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle and quickly gaining notoriety as the one to watch in the fast-casual, on-demand delivery economy. All of this said, if you're looking for ingredient transparency, you should probably look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The plan is also pricey. You’re paying for that healthy convenience. Three meals a day plus a juice and a snack costs $220 for a weekly subscription, or $44 per day. That’s $880 per month. Those living in SF likely spend closer to $400 to $500 on groceries and going out in a 30 day period, depending on how much they make and where you get the data.</p>
<p>Healthy factor: Provenance Meals starts with unprocessed ingredients sourced from local farms and organic providers, wherever possible, and meat and poultry that have been grass-fed and pasture-raised. From there, they make everything from scratch, including their own nut milks, kimchi, pickles, and sprouted beans. As for GMOs and added refined sugars? You won’t find them in your meals either.</p>
<p>What it’s all about: Order meals from Munchery‘s daily rotating menu on the website or app, and meals are delivered chilled, with instructions for heating in the microwave or oven. Price: Meals range from about $6 to $15. Place your order two or more days in advance and receive an early bird discount of 10 to 25 percent off most items. Sample Menu Item: Poblano, Corn, and Shrimp Salad: Little gem lettuce, green hot chili peppers, red tomatoes, sweet yellow corn, frisee, scallions, shrimp, lime juice, olive oil, arugula, and oregano ($6.95).</p>
<p>This worker-owned co-op is based in Berkeley, making it a nice change of pace from all the San Francisco- and Silicon Valley-centric companies. As expected, the food is all about sustainability and health. Each week features menu staples and some items that rotate. Adding to the cute/sustainable factor is that all soups, casseroles, chicken confits, stews, sauerkrauts, cheeses, and desserts come in Mason jars. Items note if they’re vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. You can pick-up your orders weekly (or join a group pickup, which rotates pickup responsibility), but meals can also be delivered via a third party to the East Bay, San Francisco, and Marin for a fee. Return the glass jars for your deposit refund.</p>
<p>Major takeaway: The company could improve by taking its cues from tip-and-tax inclusive services, apps that track where the order is in the process, and packaging that keeps an eye on waste (there are a lot of parts that end up in recycling).</p>
<p>Sourcing and sustainability: According to Sprig's tagline, all meals are "healthy and organic" — an admirable claim that no competitors listed here are able to make. While the company didn't respond to specific questions on how they comply with USDA organic standards, organic ingredients — including meat and produce sources — are noted in the ordering interface, which is not the case for the other companies compared here. All of their packaging is made from plants and completely compostable, even the plastic.</p>
<p>Delivery details: Delivery is currently available in Manhattan (below 116th Street-ish) and parts of Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, and Westchester. You can order on-demand to get your food in about 30 minutes (although as we discovered, many items sell out), or order meals up to a week in advance. FYI, Munchery also delivers in Seattle, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<h3>Healthy Food Delivery For Cancer Patients</h3><p>Spoonrocket is another San Francisco startup promising freshly prepared meals delivered in 15 minutes. Admittedly, not everything on the menu fits the health-food bill, which means you have to avert your eyes from plates of creamy mac & cheese and apple fritters while scrolling to more healthful options (salads, wraps, smoothies, and more). Deliveries are made throughout the Bay Area and Seattle.</p>
<p>Smoothies are delish, but chopping up all those ingredients can get tedious. Green Blender ships perfectly portioned, locally sourced ingredients, so all you have to do is blend. The subscription service sends ingredients for five new recipes every week, and each comes with a quick write-up on its nutritional benefits. Cranberry kumquat tart, for example, is packed with vitamin C, fiber, and calcium. Each recipe yields two 12-ounce servings. The box of smoothie supplies won’t replace meal prep for the week, but the price definitely beats your local juice bar.</p>
<p>Sourcing and sustainability: According to a Munchery representative, each chef selects ingredients according to their personal standards, prioritizing seasonal, local, all-natural, and organic "when possible" — though it's unclear how often that is, or if there is a base company standard. A company rep says that suppliers include some well-known, local artisan purveyors, such as Cowgirl Creamery and Hodo Soy, but others are Tom Cat Bakery in New York and Shibumi Farms in New Jersey, and we couldn't find mention of any of these brands in the app. As for its packaging, "most" of it is made from recyclable materials and compostable.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: Pretty, patterned, biodegradable packaging makes Munchery’s tasty meals a statement piece for your desk as much as a lunch time-saver. Dishes are designed by talented chefs and range from vegan Moroccan vegetables to Asian beef stew. Same-day meals sell out quickly, though, so the ordering process can be slightly frustrating.</p>
