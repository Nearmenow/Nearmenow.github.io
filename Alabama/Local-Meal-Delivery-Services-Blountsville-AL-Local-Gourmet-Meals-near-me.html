							<p> <a href="./index.html">Health</a><br>Healthy Food Delivery Nyc Blountsville 35031<p>To help you get dinner on the table, we answered the doorbell on numerous occasions to test out the offerings. Here, we bring you the need-to-know details on 11 services that deliver delicious healthy meals in the five boroughs (listed alphabetically) Blountsville 35031.</p>
<p>NYC is full of great restaurants, but they aren't set up for take-out and delivery, according to co-founder and CEO Caleb Merkl. That's where Maple comes in. The recipes have been created and tested by chefs and are not from already established restaurants. Executive Chef Soa Davies came to Maple from Le Bernardin, the high temple of sophisticated and delicious food. The Culinary Board of Directors includes esteemed chefs Dan Kluger, Brooks Headley and Mark Ladner. The ingredients are sourced locally whenever possible and are always seasonal. Menu items include what the team is calling balanced meals. When you order lunch or dinner, you don't just get chicken, or fish, you get chicken or fish with a vegetable and a starch (or the rough equivalent).</p>
<h4>Healthy Food Delivery With Recipes Jefferson 35031</h4><p>Delivery: 11 a.m. - 11 p.m., Monday - Friday. Addresses south of Chambers Street in the Financial District only, though company executives are aiming for city-wide and eventually, nationwide expansion.</p>
<img alt="new food delivery services trend toward home-cooked and healthy" src="http://blog.onemedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Hello-Fresh.jpg" width="856" height="480"><p>Need to know: No, there’s nothing ancient about getting packaged food delivered, but who has the energy to cook after a crushing CrossFit session? Kettlebell Kitchen makes eating balanced, fresh, Paleo-centric meals—like grass-fed beef with sauteed kale—super easy by partnering with fitness spots like CrossFit boxes and UFC Gyms for pickups.</p>
<p>Delivery details: Fresh Direct has delivery experience, and it showed, proving it to be uber reliable, key for someone with a busy schedule. Two-hour time slots run every day of the week from about 6:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., and they call or text you to let you know if your delivery is running late. They deliver throughout New York City, as well as in Long Island, Westchester, and parts of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware, plus in the Hamptons and Jersey Shore during the summer.</p>
<h4>Healthy Food Delivery Options</h4><p>Fully cooked meals are delivered fresh to your doorstep every day, Monday through Friday. Should you want weekend food, that gets delivered with Friday’s food. Meals come in reusable cooler bags with ice packs. Food comes packaged in our zero waste packaging solution from World Centric. The containers and lids are made from pressed vegetable materials. The containers are oven friendly. We suggest heating dinners right in the containers at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Containers should be put into regular trash or compost. They breakdown into compost in 90 days.</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/qPKltDtPVZQ" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>This health-conscious service, which officially launched in New York last month, consulted a nutritionist when designing the dishes, CEO and founder Pedro Rivas said. For each option (there are two or three, depending on the day) they give users nutrition counts, ingredients, as well as the recipes if you want to recreate it yourself. GoodMeal is focusing on dinner, Rivas said, because he believes there is a larger unsatisfied need for healthy prepared dinners. Prices generally range from $10-15.</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/dBPxFguaz_E" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>What it’s all about: Based on a “whole-food, plant-rich diet,” this organic food delivery program delivers balanced, seasonal meals and has a strict policy against processed foods, additives, preservatives, and added sugar. Price: Five days of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners will set you back $410. If you choose just one meal per day, the price goes down to $160. You can also invest in more long-term programs like the 20-day service ($1,390 for all meals), or opt for a one-day “cleanse” ($99). Sample item: Coriander spiced cauliflower flat bread with arugula pesto and wild mushrooms.</p>
<p>What it’s all about: Custom farm-to-table meals made from organic, sustainable, locally sourced ingredients are delivered to your doorstep, along with reheating instructions. You can order individual meals or the Fridge Full of Food (FFoF), which contains several meals in one package. Meals are customizable based on dietary preferences and requirements and options include Paleo-friendly meals as well as plans tailored for weight-loss. Price: $32 per lunch or dinner, $20 per breakfast, $8 per snack, and $92 for a full day (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks). Delivery costs are $20 to most of Manhattan, and deliveries can be made throughout the five boroughs and NYC area for an additional fee. Sample item: Poached wild-caught salmon with panang curry sauce.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: Sakara is the go-to service for downtown women who work out at ModelFit, live in Lucas Hugh leggings, and are no strangers to green juice. Expect delicious, fresh, creative salads, soups, and sandwiches—stuffed to the brim with trendy superfoods. They switch up the menu weekly (and seasonally), so if you’re planning on becoming a regular, you won’t get bored.</p>
<h3>Healthy Food Delivery To Your Door</h3><p>Healthy factor: Sakara was created for the busy, stylish New York woman, and founders Whitney Tingle and Danielle DuBoise take pride in ensuring that each meal serves a healthful purpose. “We source the highest quality ingredients, ensuring not only that every food we work with is free of any harmful additives, but that they come packing an even higher nutrient density,” says Tingle. Ingredients, again, are whole-food, plant-based and “mostly” organic and local. Meals are free of gluten, dairy, eggs, meal, and seafood. And for those on the East Coast and Southern California, Sakara Life can accommodate up to three allergies for an additional fee.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: Have you ever dreamed of having your own personal chef? Portable Chef makes that happen. The company is all about getting organic food from the farm to your table, customized to your individual likes (and dislikes) and dietary requirements.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: Picnic’s founders are on a mission to help you step away from the processed food by making healthy eating super convenient. The best part? For every meal purchased, Picnic donates a meal to someone in need through the Food Bank for New York City.</p>
<p>Healthy factor: Diced’s meals lean toward the fresh and healthy and replicate some of your favorite meals like General Tso’s Chickpeas and Vegan Quinoa Chili with Cornbread. Ingredient and calorie counts are available online for all meals.</p>
<p>We don’t use any gluten, cow’s dairy, refined grain or sugar, but within these parameters we make some magic happen. Our clients still enjoy bagels for breakfast, wraps for lunch and steak for dinner. Our food is organic, all animal products are pasture raised and all the seafood we use is wild.</p>
<p>Delivery: Sunday through Thursday from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., and is based around the Gramercy Park, Union Square, Chelsea area for now. They expect to expand into other areas of Manhattan slowly and then believe they will be in Brooklyn in about 9 months.</p>
<img alt="healthy meal delivery near me" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/lukethistlefbcover.png" width="856" height="480"><p>Healthy factor: Daily Harvest’s chef- and nutritionist-designed blends include a hearty dose of fruits and veggies (flash-frozen at the peak of ripeness), functional superfoods like wheatgrass and flax seed, and tasty add-ins like nut butters. Ingredients are organic and non-GMO wherever possible. Choose from 14 super fun flavors like Matcha Colada (think piña colada with matcha, plus extra hints of coconut, vanilla, and good-for-you kale) or decadent Chocolate Lovahhh, a mix of blueberries, bananas, dates, maca, raw almond butter, spinach, kale, and pink Himalayan sea salt.</p>
<p>What it’s all about: Designed for “weight loss and healthy living,” the gourmet delivery service offers five different programs ranging from gluten-free eating to post-natal nutrition. Once you select the length of your program online, you’ll receive two to four days’ worth of color-coded meals to take the guesswork out of planning. Price: Women are charged $47.95 per day, and men pay $49.95 (they receive an extra snack with their meals). Sample item: Rosemary glazed turkey breast with roasted peppers and French green lentils.</p>
