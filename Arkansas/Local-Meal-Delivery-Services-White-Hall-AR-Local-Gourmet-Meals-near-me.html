<p>Healthy factor: Since it’s Paleo, you know your meals will be full of grass-fed and pastured protein and in-season produce, as well as free of gluten, soy, dairy, eggs, and sweeteners. Plus, the delivery service has developed relationships with local suppliers and farmers from whom they source ingredients.</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/Qw8aioa3vOs" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>The details: There are 10 different recipes offered each week, each served in either two- or four-person servings.

The easy-to-follow, minimal-step meals come in meat and vegetarian options—everything from pork tenderloin with cauliflower mash and snap peas to chickpea- and superfood-laced salads—and are offering up breakfast now. Which means you can get down with breakfast for dinner, a personal favorite of ours, anytime.</p>
<p>Kafe Noir prepares only one option for their customers which differs every single week. Their food are attention-grabbing because the menu is creative and unique. They able to cook a delicious meal by combining two different food categories to become one healthy meal.

<h4>Healthy Food Delivery For Families</h4><p>Need-to-know: Maybe you can’t find high-quality, Paleo-friendly ingredients. Or you’ve had the same steak and roasted veggie combo on repeat for weeks. Or maybe you just can’t imagine cooking dinner after a crushing a WOD. Whatever it is, Pete’s Paleo will take care of you. The San Diego-based company plans, shops, cooks, and delivers meals from its weekly seasonal menu right to your door. Think Ethiopian Spiced Duck with Roasted Bell Peppers and Gold Beets and Braised Pork with Sweet Potato Hash and Braised Celery. All you have to do is reheat and serve (setting the table: optional).</p>
<p>Healthy factor: All of Veestro’s meals are 100 percent plant-based and made with organic, non-GMO ingredients—and free of preservatives. While some foodies may turn up their noses at frozen food, the meals are frozen when fresh so they arrive ready to reheat. While we did find that the meals had to be reheated longer than the instructions indicate, you’ll still enjoy your meal relatively quickly and with minimal cleanup.</p>

You can select from a variety of lunch packs, snacks, fruits or sprouts, and they will deliver it to you as per the mentioned timings. You can relish delicious food at your office by placing your order on their website or via phone call. So, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>Need-to-know: Get the mint juleps ready, because every week PeachDish offers four Southern- and seasonally-inspired meals (typically two vegetarian options and two meat- or fish-based choices) delivered to members. You’ll get to learn about—not to mention cook with—menu mainstays of the South, like middlins (AKA broken rice that’s a bit like grits).</p>
<p>This service is entirely vegan.

Each recipe makes enough for four meals. Snacks and dishes have included chickpea, coconut, and cashew curry, agave ginger tofu and veggie stir fry, black bean and kale tacos with fresh-made guacamole, and mint chocolate chip truffles.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: If you drool over the brightly colored veggies at your local farmers’ market, you’ll love Purple Carrot. Former New York Times columnist and cookbook author Mark Bittman teamed up with the vegan meal kit company to develop and curate your weekly menu of seasonal plant-based meals. (Think Mushroom Pho with Fresh Tofu Skins and North African Orzo Risotto with Raw Fennel Salad.) The week’s menu debuts every Friday and can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. In case you needed that extra push, it will finally convince you that going vegan is easy.</p>
