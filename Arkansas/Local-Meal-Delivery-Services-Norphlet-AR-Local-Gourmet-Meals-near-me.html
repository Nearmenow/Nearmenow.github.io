<p>Delivery details: Your meals are kept insulated in biodegradable, recycled denim—a stylish, eco-friendly alternative to styrofoam—and non-toxic, water-soluble gel packs. Freshly ships to 17 states in the western half of the U.S. and plans to expand east later this year.</p>
<p>Cost: You can now choose to “Taste It” (a one-time meal order for three or five days) or “Live It” (a weekly subscription of Sakara Life’s clean eats). Depending on whether you want just breakfast, lunch, or dinner, a combination of two, or all three, three-day Taste It plans start at $80 and five-day Taste It plans start at $125, plus delivery. Or subscribe for $69 a day and receive breakfast, lunch, and dinner five days a week.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: If you drool over the brightly colored veggies at your local farmers’ market, you’ll love Purple Carrot. Former New York Times columnist and cookbook author Mark Bittman teamed up with the vegan meal kit company to develop and curate your weekly menu of seasonal plant-based meals. (Think Mushroom Pho with Fresh Tofu Skins and North African Orzo Risotto with Raw Fennel Salad.) The week’s menu debuts every Friday and can be prepared in 45 minutes or less. In case you needed that extra push, it will finally convince you that going vegan is easy.</p>
<p>Need-to-know: Freshly promises healthy meals in two minutes or less—in other words, it’s your alternative to ordering Seamless on days when you’re too busy to even set the table (never mind cook). Your meals arrive at your door—not frozen, but fully cooked—so that all you have to do is reheat. Choose breakfast, lunch, or dinner from Freshly’s weekly menu, with Three Bean Ancho Turkey Chili and Denver Omelette among the customer favorites. And yes, they plan on expanding their menu throughout the year.</p>
<p>I have been with naked fitfoods longer since my last review. The food is consistently great as well the variety of the meals. Customer service is excellent! I am still losing weight by sticking to the paleo meal plan. I never feel hungry after eating the meals and sometimes I can't even finish them. You must try!!</p>

<p>Delivery details: Delivery is currently available in Manhattan (below 116th Street-ish) and parts of Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, and Westchester.

FYI, Munchery also delivers in Seattle, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>I love cooking, catering, and impressing people with my food. People love the good-tasting food that I deliver. I handle last-minute jobs, as well as events planned months in advance. Business breakfasts and lunches are always fun because my food is crazily good, compared to what the fast-food chain employees usually serve.</p>

<h3>Healthy Food Delivery Chicago</h3><p>I loved the food we got to try at a Yelp event, so I was really excited to get started, and easily signed up online a couple of weeks later. I signed up for the Paleo menu, but asked for it to be mixed up with Vegan, even though I paid for the more expensive Paleo. After having them bring my first 3 days of meals Vegan, with broccoli every single day, I wrote and requested just Paleo from there on out. Friday was Paleo, then Monday I was back to Vegan. That was minor Problem 1. On their website, they listed what the meals were going to be for that week. I completely understand that there will have to be some substitutions some days, but it turned out that my meals almost always had a substitution. For example - one day I had two skewers of chicken for lunch, while my friend was served the cod that was listed on their online menu. That's not so terrible (even though I had chicken again the next day for lunch) - but I always seemed to get the same protein or vegetable multiple days in a row because of their substitutions. That was Problem 2. Their website also says that delivery will be between 3:30 - 9. Obviously you don't want food sitting out too long in Florida weather, even if it is in the flimsy soft bag cooler you are required to purchase, with their ice pack in it.  I came home at 7 pm one evening, only to find my cooler ice pack had turned into water, and the food at room temperature. Both lunch (meat) and dinner (fish) were not safe to eat and had to be thrown out.  It turned out that because I was the first stop on the route, my meals were being dropped off at 1:45 pm. It was either that, or they rode around in the driver's car all day and were delivered between 8pm-9pm, which also happened a few days. I was told the only other thing I could do was stop and pick up my own meals by 6 pm, which I declined to do, since that defeated the whole point of using Naked Fitfoods. They ended up providing two ice packs, one of which would melt through the bag by the time I got my food, but at least the other one still retained its frozen properties. I just hated having to worry every day about whether the food would be safe to eat.  Major Problem 3. Cost & Food:  if you get the Paleo, 2 Meals Per Day, which I did, the cost is $370 which works out to $9.25 per meal.  I had many meals that would not have cost even $2.00 to make - one bad Vegan lunch meal in particular sticks in my mind which was truthfully a container of raw broccoli and mushrooms.  The description online said it was supposed to be "Roasted Mushroom, Gingered Broccoli & Pomegranate Salad  with Sauteed Spinach & Baby Carrots" HAHAHA, nope, not even remotely close.  I did think that the food was okay flavor-wise for the most part, though, with my very first Vegan dinner - a falafel waffle - being the best. I know in other reviews people have complained about service, but I will say that Paige was very, very responsive in answering my emails, and trying to correct the above referenced problems.  I think Naked Fitfoods is a good option for many people, it just wasn't a good fit for me.</p>
